Hi! This is a very simple app that can track the current price of any crypto (400+m types) using the market leading Coinmarketcap API that is free to use.
It uses python exclusively and a REST API, but maybe in the future will use some flask or django to make this available on the web.

Here are the steps to make this your own:
- In the api.py file replace the "your api key" part with your own and the url with your own, yours can be found by creating a developper's account with coinmarketcap here: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/
- It should then be ready to use. It already has the api set up and has all currencies in the crypto.py file.

Here are my next steps to make this better:
- I will integrate flask or django to make this available on the web.
- I will integrate an email scheduler to send updates on crypto prices every set interval of time (defined by users).
- I will add stocks and currencies like USD to it to also be able to track these.
- I will make it able to track other things than current price, like maybe past price or expected price and maybe even a way to purchase these.
- This is a fun side project, so i do not intend to charge anything for now.

Enjoy! -
Josh
